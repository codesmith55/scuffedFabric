Basic Search Operators.
AND, OR, NOT (represented by a minus sign).

These are pretty simple, you can use these to include or exclude certain words from search results. 
Example:
dell AND apple (results that include both words).
dell OR apple (results that include either of words).
dell -apple (results that include dell but not apple).

Note: In regular searches, google defaults to AND anyway, so it doesn’t matter make much difference. But it can be quite useful when combined with other operators..
WildCards and Exact Match.

Wildcards and exact match search serve very different purposes. Exact match search is when you tell the search engine to show results that contain the exact phrase..

This is done by including the phrase in double-quotes..

Wildcards simply mean, match any word or phrase. Quite useful if you forgot part of the word or phrase you wanted to search. There are represented by an asterisk..

Aside: I also find these pretty useful for searching memes 😛 As you’ll see in the examples..

Example:.

“we’re hitting” “levels never thought possible”.

we’re hitting * levels never thought possible.

Knowing these little tricks and having the ability to combine them is quite powerful. But there is more! Keep reading to know some of the advanced google search tips I use quite often at work..
Advanced Search Operators.

These are pretty simple yet powerful search operators. Using them will make you feel like a search engine God. Let’s see some examples..
site:.

Limit the search results to a particular site. Example:.

site:stackoverflow.com regex javascript.
inurl:.

Include results whose URL contain the word or phrase. I find this extremely helpful when I want to look for something in an online documentation site that’s hard to navigate. Example:.

inurl:developer.linkedin.com “pagination”.

You can also sneak wildcards in there:.

site:*.facebook.com “access tokens” “api”.

inurl:admin-sdk site:*.google.com “reseller api”.
filetype:.

This operator lets you search on filetypes. Example:.

filetype:pdf “machine learning”.

filetype:docx “metaprogramming”.
